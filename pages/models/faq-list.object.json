    "Question": "What drums/sticks do you recommend I get for lessons?",
    "Answer": "I recommend each student gets a pair of Vic Firth 5A Drumsticks. Depending on your musical goals, students will start with a drum pad or a drum set. A drum pad is a smaller investment that allows a student to try out the drums before deciding to buy a drum set. I recommend an Evans Real Feel 12 Inch Drum Pad. If a student is looking to buy an electronic drum set, I would recommend the Alesis Nitro Mesh or Turbo Mesh Electronic Drum Set. If a student would prefer an acoustic drum set, I would recommend the PDP Encore Series or the Ludwig Accent Series. Message me for more in-depth recommendations!"
